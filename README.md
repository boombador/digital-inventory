# Building

This is an attempt at a "minimal" webpack build. Before development or deployment you will need to
install the project dependencies via npm or yarn:

    npm install

## Development

Start the dynamically rebuilding development server, by default listening at `http://localhost:9000`

    npm run build:watch

This command uses [Webpack Dev Server] to dynamically rebuild the project when known resources are
modified. Javascript and other resource types under `src/` can be used with the `require` or
`import` syntax. In this mode the dev server won't bother writing generated files to disk,
additionally files under `static/` will be served at that subpath, but any other path will return
the index resource.

The [HtmlWebpackPartialsPlugin] allows you to include blocks of html. Currently the configuration in
`webpack.config.js` injects `src/partials/basic-body.html` into the generated `index.html` resource.

## Production

    npm run build:prod

When building in production mode the result of the bundle will be placed in `dist/`
along with the `index.html` generated by the [HtmlWebpackPlugin] which takes care of importing any
js or asset bundles.

# Code Overview

Any import paths starting with `@/` are relative to the `src/` directory, configured at the property
`resolve.alias`.
